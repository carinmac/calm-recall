â€œHi Caregivers. We understand the endless questions, the repeated stories, and the constant vigilance required when caring for someone with brain changes. You're doing incredibly important work, and we know how exhausting it can be.

Calm Recall was created by caregivers who've walked in your shoes. Our hope is that this app gives you a moment to breathe, a chance to step away, knowing your loved one still hears your voice and receives the consistent, reassuring answers they need.

We can't take away all the challenges, but we can help shoulder some of the repetition. Because you deserve support too.

Let's get started setting up Calm Recall to give you back some of your time while providing your loved one with the comfort of your familiar voice and responses.

â€”------------------------

If youâ€™re supporting someone with memory changes or dementia, we see you.

The repeated questions. The same stories, told over and over. The constant alertness. Itâ€™s a kind of care that asks a lotâ€”and you show up for it every day.

Often, those repeated questions arenâ€™t just memory lossâ€”they can be a sign of anxiety or confusion. Thatâ€™s where Calm Recall comes in.

**Created by people whoâ€™ve been where you are,** Calm Recall helps you gently respondâ€”even when youâ€™re not in the room. With your familiar voice, it offers consistent, comforting replies to help ease worry and maintain a sense of calm.

We know this journey isnâ€™t easy. We canâ€™t take away all the challenges, but we can help with the repetition, so you can catch your breath while still offering reassurance.

Letâ€™s get started setting up Calm Recall, to give your loved one the comfort of your voice, and give you a little space to rest, reset, and keep going.
