## üìã Daily Cursor Sessions

### Session Structure (Recommended)
1. **Start**: Review previous session's checklist items
2. **Focus**: Work on 3-5 related checklist items per session
3. **Test**: Verify each completed item works as expected
4. **Document**: Note any issues or deviations from spec
5. **Plan**: Identify next session's focus items

### Cursor Prompting Strategy
```
For each component, give Cursor:
1. The exact checklist item you're working on
2. Relevant type definitions from your specs
3. Mock data if needed
4. Specific requirements from the detailed specs
5. Integration points with other components
```

This systematic approach ensures nothing falls through the cracks and gives you clear progress tracking throughout the build process.
